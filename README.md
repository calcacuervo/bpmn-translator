BPMN Translator
====================

This module intends to provide basis on generating BPMN 2.0 processes automatically.
It provides a model, which is simple and with less constructions than the BPMN 2.0 spec, and will provide services to translate it as a BPMN 2.0 file. This is helpful on migrations from other bpm tools to BPMN 2.0 for example.
